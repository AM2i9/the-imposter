# The Imposter - An Among Us Discord bot
# Created by Patrick Brennan(AM2i9)
# https://github.com/AM2i9/the-imposter
#------------------------------------------------------
# So this is a discord bot I created for one of my
# friends discord servers, named Among Us ft. Niranth,
# mostly because they would not shut up when we were
# playing Among Us. And I may have added a few little
# things to it here and there, just to have a little
# more fun.
