# The Imposter

So this is a discord bot I created for one of my friends discord servers, named Among Us ft. Niranth, mostly because they would not shut up when we were playing Among Us. And I may have added a few little things to it here and there, just to have a little more fun.

### Game Management

A module that allows the users to create an embed for their Among us game in Discord, which allows others to join the VC easily. The embed also has these reaction buttons:

üîá - Toggles server mute on the host's voice channel

üéôÔ∏è - Toggles a function that server mutes the host's voice channel when they mute themselves, allowing you to use the mute keybind

‚ùå - Ends the host's game

You can easily start a game by typing this command:

```i!start <GAMESERVER> <GAMECODE>```

### Other Things

The other things that this bot has, the Music and StudyHall modules, are just little modules built for fun on my friends discord server. They are a bit buggy, so if you plan to play aoround with them watch out.
